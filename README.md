## Credit Risk Assessment Dashboard â€“ Machine Learning Project
A dynamic, end-to-end ML solution to predict loan default risk with real-time, tiered risk classification. Built with XGBoost, Streamlit, and SMOTE-enhanced learning.

ðŸš€ **Project Overview**
This project implements a production-ready machine learning pipeline to assess the credit risk of loan applicants. The model outputs a four-tier risk classification â€” Low, Medium, High, or Extremely High â€” based on a range of financial, behavioral, and employment-related features.

ðŸŽ¯ **Business Use Case**
Loan defaults cost financial institutions billions yearly. Identifying high-risk borrowers early is critical to reduce losses and improve portfolio quality. This tool:

Predicts the probability of default

Dynamically classifies borrowers into actionable risk segments

Enables loan officers and credit analysts to make informed decisions

ðŸ§  **Key Features**
1.  Dynamic Engineered Features
   -LoanToIncome = LoanAmount / (Income + 1)
   -EmploymentDurationRatio = MonthsEmployed / (Age Ã— 12 + 1)
2. Balanced Training with SMOTE
3. XGBoost Classifier with threshold tuning
4. 4-Level Risk Classification:
    -Low Risk (<30%)
    -Medium Risk (30â€“50%)
   -High Risk (50â€“75%)
   -Extremely High Risk (>75%)
5. Streamlit Front-End for live borrower persona scoring
6. Modular scripts for training, testing, and UI integration

**ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation**
Accuracy: ~83%
ROC AUC: ~0.68
Recall (Class 1 - Defaulters): ~23%
